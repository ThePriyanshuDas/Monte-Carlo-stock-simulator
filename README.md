# Monte Carlo Stock Price Simulator

A quantitative finance project that simulates future stock price paths using **Monte Carlo methods** and **Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)**. This project estimates the distribution of possible future prices and evaluates financial risk metrics such as Value at Risk (VaR).

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Financial markets are inherently stochastic. Instead of predicting a single future price, this project generates **thousands of possible price trajectories** using probabilistic modeling.

The simulation helps answer:

* What is the expected future price of a stock?
* What is the downside risk?
* What is the probability of extreme losses?

---

## ⚙️ Mathematical Model

We model stock prices using **Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)**:

$$
S_{t+1} = S_t \cdot \exp\left( (\mu - \frac{\sigma^2}{2})\Delta t + \sigma \sqrt{\Delta t} Z \right)
$$

Where:

* (S_t): Current stock price
* (\mu): Expected return (drift)
* (\sigma): Volatility
* (Z \sim N(0,1)): Random shock
* (\Delta t): Time step

## 📊 Example Results

* Simulated stock price trajectories over time
* Distribution of final stock prices
* Risk estimation using percentile-based VaR

---

## 📈 Data Source

This project can optionally use real historical stock data via
Yahoo Finance using the `yfinance` Python library.

---

## 🧠 Concepts Used

* Monte Carlo Simulation
* Geometric Brownian Motion
* Probability Distributions (Normal Distribution)
* Log Returns
* Volatility Estimation
* Risk Metrics (VaR)

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

* Assumes constant volatility
* Ignores market shocks and jumps
